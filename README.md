# ModbusJS
## Overview
This library shall provide both Modbus TCP and RTU connection layer and standard functions with error checks and all the necessary data handling for NodeJS.

At the moment the development is still in progress. The plan is to get TCP part working first with all the standard functions and then extended the library for RTU.
